"Odin Recipes"

This is a basic recipe website that will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The recipes on this website are all taken from the "Allrecipes" website and the ones I've chosen are the following:
1. Easy Chicken Gyro
2. Copy Cat Disneyland Grilled Cheese
3. Cowboy Breakfast Skillet

Currently, the website is built using HTML only and some of the the different tags and elements used in this project are:
- Headings Tags
- Pararaphs Tags
- Image Tags
- Strong and Emphasis Tags
- Ordered and Unordered Lists
- Anchor Tags
